This Python script is a data querying application that interacts with a SQLite database named "HyperionDev.db". It provides various functionalities such as viewing subjects taken by a student, looking up addresses by first name and surname, listing reviews by student ID, listing courses by teacher ID, listing students who haven't completed their course, and listing students who have completed their course with a mark of 30 or below. Users can also choose to store query results as JSON or XML files. The script is well-structured, with clear functions for different tasks, error handling, and a user-friendly command-line interface.
